# Running Frontend on Port 443 (HTTPS)

## ✅ Configuration Complete

The frontend is now configured to run on **port 443** with **HTTPS** enabled.

### Current Configuration

**Frontend (React + Vite)**
- Port: **443** (HTTPS)
- URL: **https://localhost**
- SSL: Self-signed certificate (auto-generated by @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl)

**Backend (Spring Boot)**
- Port: **8080** (HTTP)
- URL: **http://localhost:8080**

---

## 🚀 Starting the Servers

### Backend (No Admin Required)
```powershell
cd e:\aiexploration\antigravity\web-portal\backend
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

### Frontend (Requires Administrator)

**Option 1: Using the provided script**
1. Right-click on `start-frontend-admin.ps1`
2. Select "Run with PowerShell as Administrator"
3. Approve the UAC prompt

**Option 2: Manual command**
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run:
```powershell
cd e:\aiexploration\antigravity\web-portal\frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Accessing the Application

Once both servers are running:
- **Frontend**: https://localhost (port 443)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8080

**Note**: Your browser will show a security warning because we're using a self-signed certificate. This is normal for local development. Click "Advanced" and "Proceed to localhost" to continue.

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Administrator Privileges**: Port 443 requires administrator privileges on Windows
2. **Self-Signed Certificate**: The SSL certificate is self-signed, so browsers will show a warning
3. **Mixed Content**: The frontend (HTTPS) calls the backend (HTTP). Modern browsers may block this. Consider:
   - Enabling HTTPS on the backend as well, OR
   - Configuring your browser to allow mixed content for localhost

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Port 443 Already in Use
If you get an error that port 443 is already in use:
```powershell
# Find what's using port 443
netstat -ano | findstr :443

# Stop the process (replace PID with the actual process ID)
Stop-Process -Id <PID> -Force
```

### Browser Security Warning
This is expected with self-signed certificates. To proceed:
- Chrome/Edge: Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)"
- Firefox: Click "Advanced" → "Accept the Risk and Continue"

### Mixed Content Warning
If the frontend can't call the backend API due to mixed content (HTTPS→HTTP):
- Use browser developer tools to check console errors
- Consider running backend on HTTPS as well
- Or use a reverse proxy like nginx

## 📝 Files Modified

- `vite.config.js` - Added HTTPS configuration and port 443
- `package.json` - Added @vitejs/plugin-basic-ssl dependency
- All frontend API calls updated to use port 8080 for backend

---

## 🛑 Stopping the Servers

- **Backend**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
- **Frontend**: Press `Ctrl+C` in the administrator PowerShell window
